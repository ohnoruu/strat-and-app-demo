# strat-and-app-demo
Welcome to the interactive demo for Team 8521 Strategy and App Development subteam. 
Our subteam is responsible for creating our team website and scouting application, as well as learning about FRC game strategies.

In this demo we will be covering the 3 main languages involved in web dev: HTML, CSS, and JS/Javascript.
You will be creating and customizing a simple portfolio using these 3 languages.

Before starting, go to "Extensions" on the left, search "Live Server" and install the first option. 
This will allow you to view your portfolio/code from a local browser.

**IF YOU'RE ON A SCHOOL COMPUTER YOU CAN IGNORE THE ADMIN POP-UP, LIVE SERVER CAN WORK WITHOUT IT

We will be starting with the HTML file. 
After you're done installing Live Server, move to index.html on the sidebar to begin making your very own web portfolio :D
To use Live server, click "Go Live" on the bottom navigation bar of Visual Studio Code. (Either bottom left or bottom right)

Have fun! Feel free to ask any questions.
