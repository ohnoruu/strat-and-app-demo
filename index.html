Welcome to the Strategy and App Subteam Demo for Team 8521 Cyberlions!!
This subteam is revolved around web and app development as well as user interface. 
This is just a fun, quick demonstration of web development and user interface to show you the parts of web development and cool stuff you can do with web development skills. 
The comments will tell you what to focus on, so ignore any other code that might seem complicated for now, as this is only an interactive demo.\

Today, you will be interacting with different parts of web development 'languages' that make up the user interface. 
This consists of the three files on the right, index.html, script.js, style.css.

This is an HTML file! This is where you'll be starting off :)
HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. 
.html files are responsible for creating the "skeleton" of a website, app, or any user interface. 
Stuff like text, images, and buttons can be considered the "parts" of the skeleton.

    <!-- This is the html tag! This is the root tag of the HTML file, and contains everything in your HTML document. -->
    <head>
        <!-- This is the head tag! This is where you put the metadata of your website. Don't worry to much about it as this is only a demo. -->
